# parseMethods Module

Welcome to the parseMethods module! This module takes a directory with output from several metagenomics software and creates a standard table that can be easily imported into R for downstream analyses.
parseMethods is part of SEPA, a multi pipe for testing metagenomic profiling software using simulations. currently, parseMethods can process result files from pathoscope2, metamix, sigma, metaphlan (under development), and constrains (metaphlan dependent)
